# `@workspace-builder/webpack`

This is a workspace builder module for [`workspace-builder`](http://npm.im/workspace-builder).

It runs webpack in the workspace, using `webpack.config.js` in the workspace root if present, or the monorepo root if not. If no `webpack.config.js` is present, it uses webpack's default config.
